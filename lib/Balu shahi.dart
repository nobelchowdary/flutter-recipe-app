              'Balushahi is a traditional dessert originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is similar to a glazed doughnut in terms of ingredients, but differs in texture and taste. In South India, a similar pastry is known as badushah. Badushahs (also spelled bhadushah) are made from a stiff dough made with all-purpose flour, ghee and a pinch of baking soda. One-inch-diameter (25 mm), 1‚ÅÑ2-inch-thick (13 mm) discs are shaped by hand, fried in ghee or oil and dunked in thick sugar syrup to make a sugar coating. They are very sweet, but tasty with a slightly flaky texture. Badushahs are sold in sweet shops in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Badushahs have been served at Bimbis at Pazhvangadi in Thiruvananthapuram[2] and at Sri Rama Vilas (better-known Gundappas hotel).'),
